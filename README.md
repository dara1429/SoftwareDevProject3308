# SoftwareDevProject3308
This is an semester-long project for Software Development class at CU Boulder

**Team Members:** Sheila Doherty - irishsheila, Rafael Espinoza - rambon99, Justin Bryan - justinhxc, Daniel Rapacchietta - dara1429, Madison Razook - mara5374

**Title:** Rhythmic Color - working title

**Description:** a simple rhythm game that will be timing button similar to other rhythm games.

**Vision Statement:** Fun, challenging, and colorful game to enjoy your own music.

**Motivation:** Have fun and have new experience coding something different.

**Risks:** Unfamiliar with language. Not sure if we will do pc version or mobile version. If we use Unity it might take awhile to learn before we can impliment anything.

**Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:** spread the work evenly so no one is overwhelmed and work together so no one feels alone. Start small with a simple mp3 so we can work on getting the syncronization between notes we need to hit and the song.

**Stories:**
(Story Points used for requirement size)

1. As a player, I want to use my own devices music so that I can enjoy the game to its fullest. (estimate : 100pts)

2. As a player, I want to have separate difficulties so i can enjoy the game at my own skill level. (estimate : 10pts)

3. As a player, I want to experience visual feedback when playing so i can see how well i am doing. (estimate : 50pts)

4. As a player, I want to tap/press notes corresponding to the music so that i can feel the rythum while playing. (estimate : 80pts)

5. As a player, I want to have engaging visuals so that the game will be more enjoyable to play. (estimate : 25pts)

6. As a player, I want to play a bug-free game so that I can enjoy the game to its fullest. (50tps)
