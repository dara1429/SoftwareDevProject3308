# SoftwareDevProject3308
This is an semester-long project for Software Development class at CU Boulder

**Team Members:** Sheila Doherty - irishsheila, Rafael Espinoza - rambon99, Justin Bryan - justinhxc, Daniel Rapacchietta - dara1429, Madison Razook - mara5374

**Title:** Rhythmic Color - working title

**Description:** A simple musical rhythm game that will be use timing button (similar to other rhythm games).

**Vision Statement:** Fun, quick, challenging and colorful game to enjoy your own music.

**Motivation:** A fun project that our team will enjoy working on and help us to explore and develop new coding skills.

**Risks:** Unfamiliar with language. Not sure if we will do pc version or mobile version. If we use Unity it might take awhile to learn before we can impliment anything. Teammates have very different course schedules, so meeting up to work together is a challenge. 

**Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:** Apread the work evenly so no one is overwhelmed and work together so no one feels alone. Start small with a simple mp3 so we can work on getting the syncronization between notes we need to hit and the song. Assign research task for learning new material. Utilize Slack and Skye for team communication when in-person meetings are not possible.
